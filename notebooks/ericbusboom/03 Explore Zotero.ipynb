      "SUMMARY OF MAJOR FINDINGS, CONCLUSION AND \n",
      "RECOMMENDATIONS \n",
      "According to Zhang and et al (2018: 8-14), the development of IPs in \n",
      "Ethiopia has six major objectives: \n",
      "A) To improve sustainability and resilience of economic growth ; \n",
      "B) To enhance contribution of manufacturing to national economy ; \n",
      "C) To stimulate stagnant exports and foreign direct investment ; \n",
      "D) To alleviate foreign exchange shortages ; \n",
      "E) To reduce borrowing funded government and SOE investment, and  \n",
      "F) To transfer the lead of growth from public to private sector.  \n",
      "And, this study has addressed all of them in one or in the way. The parks, \n",
      "in their start-up phase, are performing well in creating job opportunity, attracting \n",
      "FDIs and earning hard currency, contributed a lot in avoiding possible land \n",
      "grabbing and state-citizens conflict over land etc. Thus, it is sound to conclude \n",
      "that the prospects of the parks given how they are performing in their start-up \n",
      "phase is very promising despite there are challenges related to: lack of well-\n",
      "trained and skilled manpower, absence of supply chain of local raw/semi-\n",
      "finished materials with the parks, inefficient trade finance and banking process, \n",
      "inefficient port operation and expensive shipping services, lack of capable, \n",
      "experienced Institutional, Regulatory, and to administer and manage the parks; \n",
      "poor local development in the areas where the IPs are. Thus, the study \n",
      "recommends:  \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "104 \n",
      "Ø \n",
      "The current regime which is in power since May, 1991 in Ethiopia has \n",
      "been investing a lot of capital in the educational sector increasingly. For instance \n",
      "in 1982, the then government, Dergue, invested about 2.10% of country’s GDP \n",
      "on the education sector while the FDRE government increases the share of the \n",
      "sector to 5.50% of the GDP in 2006, 5.60% of the GDP in 2012, and drops to \n",
      "4.50% of the GDP in 2013 as Knoema Corporation (2013). However, building \n",
      "public Universities or TVETs or schools is not enough as it has been done so far. \n",
      "But, the quality of education shall not put in to question and compromise. The \n",
      "education in TVETs and engineering schools shall be more of practical, not \n",
      "theoretical as before. Plus, there should be a sustainable Industry-University \n",
      "linkage so that students will learn practically on the spot, and IPs shall serve as \n",
      "training and excellence centres.  \n",
      "Ø \n",
      "As this study found out that there is no any business link between local \n",
      "firms and companies in the IPs in which this will negatively affect hard currency \n",
      "generating capacity of the country and the so aimed technology transfer. Thus, \n",
      "the government should encourage domestic firms and investors to empower them \n",
      "financially so that they will invest in joint venture with well-known international \n",
      "manufacturing companies through which in the long process domestic firms will \n",
      "be in place taking over international companies in Ethiopia. \n",
      "Ø \n",
      "Given Ethiopia’s existing Institutional, Regulatory, and administrative \n",
      "capacity, it is hard to continuously and sustainably attract FDIs. Thus, the \n",
      "government at all levels shall upgrade and reform its banking system, its \n",
      "institutional structure and bureaucracy free from rent seeking and corruption as \n",
      "much as possible.  \n",
      "Ø \n",
      "The government shall also work day-and-night on the development of \n",
      "ports with the neighbouring countries so that port costs will decrease in importing \n",
      "goods for-and-exporting goods produced the parks with possible low cost and \n",
      "good efficiency.  \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "105 \n",
      "Ø \n",
      "The parks in Ethiopia are highly export oriented despite the government \n",
      "also aims on import substitution. And, their activities so far indicate that the parks \n",
      "are not performing well on import substitution. Just, they are importing raw and \n",
      "semi-finished products for their production process. Thus, the government shall \n",
      "encourage and supply domestic investors with financial support to engage in \n",
      "supplying of semi-finished products with best possible quality to the parks.  \n",
      "Ø \n",
      "Finally, the government in coordination with the private sector, and \n",
      "investors shall built rental residential houses to supply for workers in the parks \n",
      "with reasonable and affordable cost. And, city administrations shall have a \n",
